A woman is seen walking in the streets of Tokyo.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:08.427
the streets look wet on a night that seems to be a weekend night by the atmosphere that is observed

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:10.943
she wears the latest fashion

00:00:11.732 --> 00:00:15.896

incredible advances that will bring great consequences for the cinematographic world.

00:00:44.374 --> 00:00:48.354
Will it be able to generate motion pictures in just a few seconds and at no cost to .....?

00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:52.514
